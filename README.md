# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to our mob session!

In our team we use mob programming as a way to learn from each other and use everyone's minds to create solutions with the highest value.

We are a platform team serving the rest of the organization. That means that our users consists of both end-users using our products and developers developing them.

> To provide a modern, consistent up-to-date developer experience for Greenbyters, and a good customer experience of the platform."

## Team values

We value maintainable, testable and clean code.

We also value accessible, composable and testable components. We believe that components, in almost all cases, should be pure and controlled.
